# numpy_ltspice_filter

A python module for seamless integration of analog filters designed in LTspice into Python3/Numpy
signal processing projects.

For a demonstration of its uses:

run ./filter_demo.py
and ./fast_convolution_filter_demo.py

and a follow-up article about fast convolution filtering using LTspice:

The utilities in this repository heavily rely on
the PyLTSpice module developed by Nuno Brum.
It is now a pip package. Install via:
sudo pip3 install PyLTSpice

A warm thank you to Nuno.
